Below you can find the slides for the intro session:

<div>

```{=html}
<iframe class="slide-deck" src="slides/slides.qmd" width = "800" height = "400"></iframe>
```

</div>

If you want to see the slides in full screen, you can click [here](slides/slides.qmd){target="_blank"}. To download them as PDFs, hit the 'e' button when you got the presentation open and then Ctrl+P print to PDF. This will work best in Chrome (in Firefox, it didn't print the headings for me).
